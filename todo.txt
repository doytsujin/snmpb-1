Maintenance:
- use better icons, e.g. https://github.com/iconic/open-iconic (MIT)
- rework the build system, allow shared/static linking choice & keep windows build easy
- out-of-tree build
- meson build
- windows "portable" build
- add CI builds/releases
- investigate forks (3 on SF, a few on GitHub)
- .toLatin1() will probably not work on non-UTF-8 locales
